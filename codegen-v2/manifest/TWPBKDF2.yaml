  comments:
  - Derives a key from a password and a salt using PBKDF2 + Sha256.
  - \param password is the master password from which a derived key is generated
  - \param salt is a sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt
  - \param iterations is the number of iterations desired
  - \param dkLen is the desired bit-length of the derived key
  - \return the derived key data.
